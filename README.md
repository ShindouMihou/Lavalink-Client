# Lavalink Client [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/ShindouMihou/Lavalink-Client.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#freyacodes/Lavalink-Client)

## This is a fork of JDA's version, porting to Javacord.
Please expect any information on this README to be suited straight for Javacord.

## Installation
Lavalink does not have a maven repository and instead uses Jitpack.
You can add the following to your POM if you're using Maven:
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.ShindouMihou</groupId>
        <artifactId>Lavalink-Client</artifactId>
        <version>x.y.z</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Or Gradle:

```groovy
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }

    dependencies {
        compile group: 'com.github.ShindouMihou', name: 'Lavalink-Client', version: 'x.y.z'
    }
```

### Jitpack versions
Jitpack versioning is based on git branches and commit hashes, or tags. Eg:

```
ab123c4d
master-SNAPSHOT
dev-SNAPSHOT
3.2
```

***Note:*** The above versions are for example purposes only.

Version tags of this client are expected to roughly follow lavalink server versioning.

## Usage
This guide assumes you have Javacord in your classpath, and your bot is written with Javacord.

### Configuring Lavalink
All your shards should share a single Lavalink instance. Here is how to construct an instance:

```java
JavacordLavalink lavalink = new JavacordLavalink(
                myDiscordUserId,
                fixedNumberOfShards,
                shardId -> a way to get the Discord API
        );
```

The interesting part is the third parameter, which is a `Function<Integer, DiscordApi>`.
You must define this `Function` so that Lavalink can get your current DiscordApi instance for that shardId.

You can now register remote nodes to your Lavalink instance:
```java
lavalink.addNode(new URI("ws://example.com"), "my-secret-password");
```

If a node is down Lavalink will continue trying to connect until you remove the node.
When a node dies Lavalink will attempt to balance the load unto other nodes if they are available.

Next when you are building a shard, you must register Lavalink as an event listener to bind your shard.
You may not register more than one Lavalink instance per shard.

```java
new DiscordApiBuilder()
        .setToken(...)
        .setIntents(...)
        .addListener(lavalinkInstance)
        .addListener(lavalinkInstance.getVoiceInterceptor())
        ...
```

### The Link class
The `JavacordLink` class is the state of one of your guilds/servers in relation to Lavalink.
A `JavacordLink` object is instantiated if it doesn't exist already when invoking `JavacordLavalink#getLink(Guild/String)`.

```java
JavacordLink someLink = myLavalink.getLink(serverId);
someLink = myLavalink.getLink(serverId);
```

Here are a few important methods:
* `connect(VoiceChannel channel)` connects you to a VoiceChannel.
  * Note: This also works for moving to a new channel, in which case we will disconnect first.
* `disconnect()` disconnects from the VoiceChannel.
* `destroy()` resets the state of the `Link` and removes Lavalink's internal reference to this Link. This `Link` should be discarded.
* `getPlayer()` returns an `IPlayer` you can use to play music with.

The `IPlayer` more or less works like a drop-in replacement for Lavaplayer's `AudioPlayer`. Which leads me to...

**Warning:** You should not use Javacord's `VoiceChannel#connect()` or `AudioConnection#close()` when Lavalink is being used. Use `Link` instead.

### Using Lavalink and Lavaplayer in the same codebase
One of the requirements for Lavalink to work with FredBoat was to make Lavalink optional, so we could support selfhosters who do not want to run Lavalink. (This has since been removed from FredBoat).

Lavalink-Client adds an abstraction layer:
* `IPlayer` in place of `AudioPlayer`
* `IPlayerEventListener` in place of `AudioEventListener`
* `PlayerEventListenerAdapter` in place of `AudioEventAdapter`

What this means is that if you want to use Lavaplayer directly instead, you can still use `IPlayer`.
```java
IPlayer myNewPlayer = isLavalinkEnabled
        ? lavalink.getLink(guildId).getPlayer()
        : new LavaplayerPlayerWrapper(myLavaplayerPlayerManager.createPlayer());
```

### Node statistics
Lavalink-Client allows access to the client WebSockets with `Lavalink#getNodes()`.
This is useful if you want to read the statistics and state of a node connection.

Useful methods:
* `isAvailable()` Whether or not we are connected and can play music.
* `getRemoteUri()` Returns a `URI` of the remote address.
* `getStats()` Returns a nullable `RemoteStats` object, with statistics from the Lavalink Server. Updated every minute.

# Common pitfalls
If you are experiencing problems with playing audio or joining a voice channel with Lavalink please check to see if all these apply to you:

1. You are adding the Lavalink instance to your DiscordApi *before* building it. Lavalink must be able to receive the ready event.
2. You don't have multiple Lavalink instances.
3. You don't attempt to join a voice channel via Javacord directly (for example, **DO NOT** `someVoiceChannel.connect()` but instead `link.connect(someVoiceChannel)`).
